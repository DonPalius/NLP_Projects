    "# Task: Implementing the Lesk Algorithm and Evaluating its Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this task, you are required to implement the Lesk algorithm from scratch, avoiding the use of any existing implementations such as nltk.\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Obtain the SemCor corpus, which is annotated with WordNet synsets. You can download it from the following URL: [SemCor Corpus](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementation and Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Extract 50 sentences from the SemCor corpus.\n",
    "   - For each sentence, perform word sense disambiguation for at least one noun. Use the Lesk algorithm that you have implemented.\n",
    "   - Calculate the accuracy of your implemented system by comparing the assigned senses with the annotated senses in SemCor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Randomization and Average Accuracy**\n",
    "   - Randomly select 50 sentences from the SemCor corpus.\n",
    "   - Randomly select nouns from these sentences for word sense disambiguation.\n",
    "   - Run the word sense disambiguation process multiple times (e.g., 10 times).\n",
    "   - Calculate the average accuracy of your system's performance across these executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **corpus-Lesk Algorithm**\n",
    "   - Implement the Lesk algorithm using the SemCor corpus.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a simplified version of the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation using WordNet synsets. The Lesk algorithm aims to determine the most suitable sense of a word within a given context by comparing the overlap of the word's signature with the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `remove_punctuation(sentence)`\n",
    "This function removes punctuation from a sentence, excluding hyphens and underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `signature(sense, stop_words)`\n",
    "This function computes the signature of a WordNet synset. The signature includes the synset's definition and words from its examples, excluding specified stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `compute_overlap(signature, context)`\n",
    "This function calculates the overlap between a synset's signature and a given context in terms of the number of shared words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `extract_nouns_index(sentence, pos)`\n",
    "This function identifies the indexes of nouns in a sentence based on their POS tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `simplified_lesk(word, sentence, stop_words)`\n",
    "This function performs a simplified Lesk algorithm. It finds the synset that best matches the given word within a specific sentence context, using the overlap between synset signatures and context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `semcor_extraction(sentence_number=50)`\n",
    "This function extracts a specified number of sentences containing random nouns from the SemCor corpus. It returns the extracted sentences along with the extracted noun lemmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `select_lemma(lemmas)`\n",
    "This function randomly selects a lemma from a list of lemmas, ensuring it represents a single word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `remove_word(sentence, word)`\n",
    "This function removes a chosen word from a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow - utility functions\n",
    "1. The code imports necessary libraries and modules.\n",
    "2. Various utility functions are defined for text processing and Lesk algorithm steps.\n",
    "3. The path to the SemCor corpus is provided.\n",
    "4. Stop words are loaded from a file.\n",
    "5. The `semcor_extraction()` function is defined to extract random sentences and their associated noun lemmas from SemCor.\n",
    "6. The `select_lemma()` function is provided to select a lemma that represents a single word.\n",
    "7. The `remove_word()` function removes a chosen word from a sentence.\n",

    "# Performance Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Results\n",
    "After running the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation using your provided code, here are some key observations based on the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Lesk algorithm attempted to disambiguate word senses for a set of sentences extracted from the SemCor corpus.\n",
    "- For each sentence, the algorithm assigned a sense using the `simplified_lesk` function and compared it to the annotated sense from SemCor.\n",
    "- The output shows instances where the disambiguated sense matched the annotated sense and instances where it did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accuracy Analysis\n",
    "- The provided output includes disambiguation results for different sentences, along with the senses assigned by the Lesk algorithm and the annotated senses from SemCor.\n",
    "- The calculated average accuracy over 10 runs is approximately 0.45 (45%).\n",
    "- This average accuracy indicates that the Lesk algorithm's performance is moderate, suggesting that it correctly identified the sense of the target words in about 45% of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors Impacting Performance\n",
    "Several factors could contribute to the observed accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sense Overlap**: The algorithm's accuracy heavily depends on the overlap between the context words and the words in the synset signature. If there's limited overlap, the algorithm may struggle to identify the correct sense.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Context Complexity**: Complex sentence structures or sentences with multiple possible interpretations can challenge the algorithm's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality of Annotations**: The accuracy also depends on the quality of annotations in the SemCor corpus. If the corpus contains ambiguous or incorrect annotations, it can affect the evaluation.\n",
