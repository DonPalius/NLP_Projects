    "## Code Explanation: Similarity and Aggregation Analysis using Word Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements an experiment named \"Defs\" to calculate similarity and perform aggregation on dimensions of concreteness and specificity using word definitions. The experiment involves processing definitions of various words, such as \"door,\" \"ladybug,\" \"pain,\" and \"blurriness.\" The primary objective is to compute similarity scores between pairs of definitions and subsequently aggregate the scores based on the dimensions of concreteness and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Libraries and Loading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by importing essential libraries, such as `nltk`, `spacy`, and `csv`. It loads definitions from a TSV file into a dictionary named `definitions`, where the keys represent words, and the values are lists of corresponding definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `compute_similarity(definition1, definition2)`: This function calculates the similarity between two definitions. It preprocesses the text of both definitions, finds the intersection of words, and computes the normalized intersection size over the minimum length of the two definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `preprocess_text(text)`: This function tokenizes and preprocesses the given text. It converts the text to lowercase, tokenizes it, removes stop words, and performs stemming using the Porter Stemmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `words_frequency(definition1, definition2)`: This function calculates the frequency of words in two definitions. It preprocesses the text of both definitions, counts the frequency of each word, and returns the frequency of the most frequent word as a ratio of the total number of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity and Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each word in the `definitions`, the code performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculates and prints the average similarity scores between pairs of definitions.\n",
    "2. Calculates and prints the average frequency of the most frequent word in pairs of definitions.\n",
    "3. Creates two dictionaries, `word_avg_similarity_dict` and `word_avg_freq_dict`, to store word-average similarity pairs and word-average frequency pairs, respectively.\n",
    "4. Adds the word and its average similarity score to the `word_avg_similarity_dict`.\n",
    "5. Adds the word and its average frequency score to the `word_avg_freq_dict`.\n",
    "6. Prints the `word_avg_similarity_dict` and `word_avg_freq_dict`.\n",
